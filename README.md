#  Router Simulator (Java + Swing)
A simple educational project that simulates how routers forward packets based on a routing table using IP addressing and subnet matching. Built with Java and Swing, this tool demonstrates the core concept of **packet forwarding**, **longest prefix matching**, and **IP routing logic** - just like how the internet routes data between devices.

## ðŸ”Ž Overview

This project simulates how routers process and forward packets based on a **destination IP address** and a **routing table**. The GUI allows users to:

- Add routing entries (Destination IP, Subnet Mask, Next Hop)
- Enter a destination IP to simulate a packet being sent
- Check if the router forwards or drops the packet
- View routing decisions and longest prefix match in action

## âœ¨ Features

- Longest Prefix Matching logic (like real routers)
- Add or delete routing table entries
- Interactive Swing GUI for input/output
- Packet forwarding result shown clearly (Forwarded or Dropped)
- CLI version also available (optional)
