#  Router Simulator (Java + Swing)
A simple educational project that simulates how routers forward packets based on a routing table using IP addressing and subnet matching. Built with Java and Swing, this tool demonstrates the core concept of **packet forwarding**, **longest prefix matching**, and **IP routing logic** - just like how the internet routes data between devices.
